# DT2 Boss indicator
This plugin notifies players of perfect kill failures.
Made using the wiki's guidelines for perfect kills:

## Leviathan
- Any damage besides roar after sequence of attacks

## Whisperer
- Ignores tentacle damage, and melee attacks while protected against
- Any other damage prevents a perfect kill
- - (If you use ruby bolts against The Whisperer, it might tell you it's imperfect if the effect goes off)

## Duke Sucellus
- Being frozen by extremities/shadow magic
- Duke magic attacks
- Duke gaze attack
- Melee slam (not chip damage)
- Vents

## Vardorvis
- Prayer disabling projectiles
- Axe hits
- Spike hits
- Captcha failure
- Attacks off prayer
